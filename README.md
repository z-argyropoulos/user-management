# User management UI

## Description

This project has been scaffolded with Vite. This user management admin panel is made with MUI, React and styled-components. Also the Redux toolkit has been used as the main state management tool.

## How to run project locally

- Clone the repo and cd to the project directory
- Install the project's dependencies by running `yarn` or `npm i`
- Run the vite dev server by running the `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` command
- In the console a local IP address should appear. Click or copy this on a browser tab, where you can now (hopefully) see the UI in action.

PS: For the ease of use, you do not need to create a .env file from the .env.example as it is already tracked in git and included in the repo you have already cloned - of course you wouldn't want that in real life projects ;)
